Cover letters can be boring and not that interesting to read, so I thought what better way to show you I'm eligible for the job than by writing you a cover letter via creating a React website? :) 

I played around with fullpage.js (https://github.com/subtirelumihail/react-fullpage) to have that storyboard feel like a powerpoint presentation, and mo.js (https://github.com/legomushroom/mojs) for the animation burst at the end. 

Have fun, and please hire me! ;)
